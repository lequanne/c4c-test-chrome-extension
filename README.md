# c4c-test-chrome-extension 

<p>This chrome extension was built as a technique for the <a href="https://medium.com/code-for-canada/meet-the-2019-code-for-canada-fellows-6291c60a32ef">Code for Canada team at the Canada Energy Regulator</a> to visualise and test design changes on the Regulator's <a href="https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/">federal energy regulatory database, named REGDOCs,</a> in real time. This is useful because: </p>

<ul>
 <li>No access is required to the website's source files to test ideas</li>
 <li>The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy</li>
 <li>It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production as well as navigate the website with the changes</li>
 <li>Saves html and css as we test prototypes internally and within an open source environment,  Github.</li>
 <li>Creates a version history of each prototype</li>
 </ul>

<p>There are, however, many other applications for this type of extension, such as modifying the styling of a website, hiding an annoying element, auto-populating a form, or clicking something on page load--we are exploring this as we see fit.</p>
<p><strong>tl:dr this is our front-end design playground for modernizing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCTBJWSkE8/">Canada Energy Regulator's regulatory database</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Several key lines of code were inspired by <a href="https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/">this blog post</a>.</p>
